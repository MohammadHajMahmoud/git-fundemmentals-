Certainly, here are the Git commands and explanations that you can copy and paste into a Git readme file:

```markdown
# Git README

In this README, we will guide you through various Git commands and their explanations.

## View the content of file.txt

```bash
# Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS)
cat file.txt

# Windows (PowerShell)
type file.txt
```

## Overwrite the content of file.txt with "2"

```bash
# Unix-based systems
echo 2 > file.txt

# Windows (PowerShell)
sc file.txt '2'
```

## Check the differences between the working directory and the last commit

```bash
git diff
```

## Check the differences between the staged changes and the last commit

```bash
git diff --staged
```

The `git diff --staged` command is initially blank because you haven't staged any changes yet.

## Stage your changes

```bash
git add file.txt
```

## Check the differences between the working directory and the staged changes

```bash
git diff
```

## Check the differences between the staged changes and the last commit

```bash
git diff --staged
```

At this point, `git diff` will show the changes you made to the file.txt in your working directory, and `git diff --staged` will show the same changes because they are now staged.

## Overwrite the content of file.txt with "3"

```bash
# Unix-based systems
echo 3 > file.txt

# Windows (PowerShell)
sc file.txt '3'
```

## Check the differences between the working directory and the last commit

```bash
git diff
```

## Check the differences between the staged changes and the last commit

```bash
git diff --staged
```

At this point, `git diff` will show the changes from "2" to "3" in your working directory, and `git diff --staged` will be blank because you haven't staged these new changes yet.

## Run `git status` and observe that file.txt is present twice in the output.

## Unstage the change

```bash
git restore --staged file.txt
```

## Check `git status` again

```bash
git status
```

The file should no longer be listed as "Changes to be committed" but should still be listed under "Changes not staged for commit."

## Stage the change and make a commit

```bash
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Changed file.txt to 3"
```

## Overwrite the content of file.txt with "4"

```bash
# Unix-based systems
echo 4 > file.txt

# Windows (PowerShell)
sc file.txt '4'
```

## Check the content of file.txt

```bash
# Unix-based systems
cat file.txt

# Windows (PowerShell)
type file.txt
```

The content of file.txt is now "4."

## Check the status of the repository

```bash
git status
```

You will see that file.txt is listed as "Changes not staged for commit."

## To restore the content of file.txt to the last commit, use:

```bash
git restore file.txt
```

## Check the content of file.txt and the repository status

```bash
# Unix-based systems
cat file.txt

# Windows (PowerShell)
type file.txt

git status
```
